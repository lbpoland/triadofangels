We light the fire that never dies
Under the open midnight sky
Footsteps echo on the ground
One by one, we gather round
Stories carved in every stone
Dreamers fighting not alone
Raise the banner, lift the flame
Tonight we all remember the name

Feel the beat, it's in our chest
We stand as one, we rise our best

American firelight, burning through the dark
Every voice, every heart, ignites a spark
Hands up high, feel the sky
We blaze together, you and I
American firelight, shining so bright
This is our moment, this is our night

Rolling highways, small-town streets
Every soul, every heat
Generations past and new
We light the path, we carry through
With every chorus, every song
We keep the legacy strong
Raise the banner, lift the flame
Tonight we all remember the name

Feel the beat, it's in our chest
We stand as one, we rise our best

American firelight, burning through the dark
Every voice, every heart, ignites a spark
Hands up high, feel the sky
We blaze together, you and I
American firelight, shining so bright
This is our moment, this is our night
American firelight, burning through the dark
Every voice, every heart, ignites a spark
Hands up high, feel the sky
We blaze together, you and I
American firelight, shining so bright
This is our moment, this is our night
