Old porch swing, creaking slow,
Fireflies dance in the moon's soft glow.
Mom's old quilt, wrapped in my hands,
Barefoot tracing these hometown lands.
Dusty roads, memories fade,
But the stars above have always stayed.
Every dream I've ever chased,
Leads me back to this quiet place.

And when the night gets cold and wide,
I close my eyes, and I arrive…

Home beneath the stars, where the fire still burns,
Where the heart remembers, where the world still turns.
Underneath the sky, under heaven's dome,
No matter how far I roam,
I'm always home… beneath the stars.

Granddad's boots by the old oak tree,
Carved our names where no one can see.
Laughing voices on the breeze,
Songs and stories, sweet as these.
Though the years keep moving on,
The soul of this land stays strong.
Every mile, every scar,
Brings me back to who we are.

And when the night gets cold and wide,
I close my eyes, and I arrive…

Home beneath the stars, where the fire still burns,
Where the heart remembers, where the world still turns.
Underneath the sky, under heaven's dome,
No matter how far I roam,
I'm always home… beneath the stars.

Always home… beneath the stars.
