Gas pedal down on a two-lane track
Leather boots old jean jacket on my back
Radio blastin' that southern sound
Rollin' through this red white and blue town
Stars and stripes in the rearview fade
But the spirit's ridin' in my Chevrolet
Hands on the wheel heart on the line
Runnin' free on borrowed time

Neon signs flicker barroom lights
Small-town souls lightin' up the night
Fireworks crack in the summer haze
Freedom roars through the engine's blaze
Tires spinnin' dust clouds rise
Eagles soar across the skies
Crank it loud let it roar
Red white and blue to the core!

Raise your voice let 'em know
We were born for the open road!

Run the red white and blue
Chase the sun chase the truth
Guitars scream drums collide
Freedom's ridin' right by our side
Run the red white and blue
Burn it hot burn it true
No rules no chains just this ride
We're runnin' wild on the Fourth of July!

Midnight highway no one near
Just the hum of the road and the stars so clear
Every mile every fight
Leads us here under the night
Pull off the shoulder light one more
Sing the songs we all fight for
Red white and blue in our veins
Born to ride through the pouring rain


Raise your voice let 'em know
We were born for the open road!

Run the red white and blue
Chase the sun chase the truth
Guitars scream drums collide
Freedom's ridin' right by our side
Run the red white and blue
Burn it hot burn it true
No rules no chains just this ride
We're runnin' wild on the Fourth of July!
