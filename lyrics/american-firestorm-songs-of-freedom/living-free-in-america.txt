Got my boots on the dancefloor shine,
Sweat on my brow, feelin' just fine.
Bass thumpin', heart jumpin' high,
We livin' free under the red, white, sky.
From east to west, from soul to soul,
This country's got that funky roll.
No matter where you come from, bring your spark,
We light it up when the night turns dark!

Clap your hands, stomp your boots,
Raise your flag, feel the roots!

We're livin' free in America! (Oh yeah!)
Shoutin' loud in America! (Come on!)
Hands up high, under the stars,
We shake the ground, we raise the bars!
Livin' free in America! (Say what?!)
Feelin' proud in America! (Let's go!)
No matter who, no matter where,
We all belong, we all care!

City lights or small-town streets,
Every heartbeat keeps the beat.
From Harlem jazz to Texas blues,
We bring the color, we bring the moves.
Turn it up, let the world hear,
American funk from far to near!
Clap it back, shake the ground,
We're all family when the funk comes 'round.

Clap your hands, stomp your boots,
Raise your flag, feel the roots!

We're livin' free in America! (Oh yeah!)
Shoutin' loud in America! (Come on!)
Hands up high, under the stars,
We shake the ground, we raise the bars!
Livin' free in America! (Say what?!)
Feelin' proud in America! (Let's go!)
No matter who, no matter where,
We all belong, we all care!

Livin' freeâ€¦ in America.
