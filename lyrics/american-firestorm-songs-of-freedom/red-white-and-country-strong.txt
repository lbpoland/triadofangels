[Verse]
Sunburnt boots on a gravel road
Cold beer sweating that July glow
Grill's on fire steaks on the flame
Old Glory waves in the hometown frame
Pickups lined up flags on the tail
Sweet tea sippin' and a backbeat trail
Boys crack a joke girls spin and dance
It's a red white country strong romance

[Pre-Chorus]
Raise a glass raise your hands
Let 'em know we love this land!

[Chorus]
Red white and country strong
Sing it loud all night long
Bonfires stars guitars and song
This is where our hearts belong
Red white and country strong
Freedom beats in every song
Raise the flag raise the cheer
We're proud to be standing here!

[Verse]
Granddad's stories 'bout the old war days
Honored heroes in the songs we play
From boot-scuffed barns to city streets
This country anthem moves our feet
Fireworks bursting in the midnight air
Kids on shoulders waving there
Sing it back make it loud
Country proud in every crowd!

[Pre-Chorus]
Raise a glass raise your hands
Let 'em know we love this land!

[Chorus]
Red white and country strong
Sing it loud all night long
Bonfires stars guitars and song
This is where our hearts belong
Red white and country strong
Freedom beats in every song
Raise the flag raise the cheer
We're proud to be standing here!

Red white and country strongâ€¦ tonight

[Chorus]
Red white and country strong
Sing it loud all night long
Bonfires stars guitars and song
This is where our hearts belong
Red white and country strong
Freedom beats in every song
Raise the flag raise the cheer
We're proud to be standing here!
