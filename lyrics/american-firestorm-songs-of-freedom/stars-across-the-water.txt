Lanterns drift across the bay
Memories whisper they never fade away
Under the stars across the water
I hear the voice of my father's father
He said "Son this land was built on dreams
On sacrifice on freedom's seams
Hold it close hold it high
Raise it up into the sky"

And when the night falls quiet
And the lights dance on the shore
I remember who we are
What we're standing for

Stars across the water
Shining like the ones who came before
Every tear every battle
Every open door
Stars across the water
Carried on the songs we sing
We hold the line we walk the time
And let the freedom ring

Footsteps echo on this shore
Footprints left by those who swore
To build a place where we can stand
With open hearts with open hands
Flags wave softly in the breeze
Children laughing by the trees
I close my eyes I feel the past
Wrapped in every firework blast

And when the night falls quiet
And the lights dance on the shore
I remember who we are
What we're fighting for

Stars across the water
Shining like the ones who came before
Every tear every battle
Every open door
Stars across the water
Carried on the songs we sing
We hold the line we walk the time
And let the freedom ring

For every name for every stone
For every soldier never home
We light a flame we sing their song
Stars across the water we carry on

Stars across the water
Shining like the ones who came before
Every tear every battle
Every open door
Stars across the water
Carried on the songs we sing
We hold the line we walk the time
And let the freedom ring

Let the freedom ring…

Let the freedom ring…
