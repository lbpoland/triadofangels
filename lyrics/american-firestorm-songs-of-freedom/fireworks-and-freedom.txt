Grill's fired up, friends rolling in,
Coolers packed, let the night begin.
Kids run wild in the sprinkler spray,
Dogs chasing sparks down the driveway.
Radio's cranking that old-school beat,
Flip-flops tapping on the concrete.
Neighbors waving from across the fence,
Summer smiles just make sense.

Raise your glass, spin around,
Light it up, light up this town.

Fireworks and freedom, lighting up the night,
Dancing in the driveway under the sky.
Fireworks and freedom, laughter in the air,
We're singing loud like we don't care.
Fireworks and freedom, stars and stripes in bloom,
We own this moment, we own this tune.
Fireworks and freedom, let it all ignite,
We're living big on this Fourth of July night.

Grandma's smiling on the porch swing seat,
Uncle Joe's two-step on the concrete.
Kids with sparklers tracing the sky,
Lovers swaying under porch light.
Every laugh, every cheer,
Every hug pulls us near.
Raise the flag, sing the song,
Tonight we all belong.

Fireworks and freedom, lighting up the night,
Dancing in the driveway under the sky.
Fireworks and freedom, laughter in the air,
We're singing loud like we don't care.
Fireworks and freedom, stars and stripes in bloom,
We own this moment, we own this tune.
Fireworks and freedom, let it all ignite,
We're living big on this Fourth of July night.

Fireworks and freedomâ€¦ under the sky.
