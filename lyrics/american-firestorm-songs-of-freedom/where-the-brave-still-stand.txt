Under the banner's light, we stand,
Hearts on fire, hand in hand.
Fields of glory, rivers wide,
Every dream, every stride.
From the mountains to the sea,
This land lives in you and me.
Voices rise across the land,
Where the brave still stand.

Raise the song across the sky,
Let the stars and stripes fly high.

Where the brave still stand,
With freedom in their hands.
Through the dark, through the fight,
We hold the flame, we guard the light.
Where the brave still stand,
We rise on this great land.
Bound by hope, bound by pride,
Where the brave still stand tonight.

Voices echo through the years,
Songs of laughter, songs of tears.
We remember every name,
Every torch that lit the flame.
Children's laughter, eagle's cry,
We lift the banner to the sky.
Here we gather, heart to hand,
Where the brave still stand.

Raise the song across the sky,
Let the stars and stripes fly high.

Where the brave still stand,
With freedom in their hands.
Through the dark, through the fight,
We hold the flame, we guard the light.
Where the brave still stand,
We rise on this great land.
Bound by hope, bound by pride,
Where the brave still stand tonight.

Where the braveâ€¦ still stand.
