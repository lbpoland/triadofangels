From the rolling plains to the ocean wide
Golden fields where the eagles fly
Voices echo through these lands
Dreamers' hearts and workers' hands
Every flag every stone
Tells the story we call home
From every shore every sky
We raise our voices high

Hold this land hold this dream
Built on hope and everything between

This is the land that I love
Under the stars heaven above
Through every trial every storm
We hold the line we keep it warm
This is the land that I love
Bound by courage bound by blood
Raise the anthem let it rise
This is the land our hearts' prize

Footsteps echo down the years
Voices carried through the tears
We remember every name
Every spark that lit the flame
Fields of honor streets of gold
Songs of freedom brave and bold
We stand together hand in hand
Across this wide and promised land

Hold this land hold this dream
Built on hope and everything between

This is the land that I love
Under the stars heaven above
Through every trial every storm
We hold the line we keep it warm
This is the land that I love
Bound by courage bound by blood
Raise the anthem let it rise
This is the land our hearts' prize

This is the landâ€¦ that I love
