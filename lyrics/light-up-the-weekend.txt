[Verse 1]
Sunrise shining on an open road
Backseat packed let the good vibes flow
Radio up windows down
This weekend's ours  we're rollin' outta town!

[Verse 2]
Coolers packed got the flags to wave
Laughter loud yeah we're feeling brave
Fireworks waiting hearts on fire
Dreams are calling we're climbing higher!

[Pre-Chorus]
Every mile every song
We've been waiting all year long

[Chorus]
Light up the weekend we're alive tonight!
Raise up your voices under stars so bright
Dancing and dreaming hearts in the sky
Together we rise together we fly!
Whoa-oh whoa-oh 
Light up the weekend let's touch the sky!

[Chorus]
Light up the weekend we're alive tonight!
Raise up your voices under stars so bright
Dancing and dreaming hearts in the sky
Together we rise together we fly!
Whoa-oh whoa-oh 
Light up the weekend let's touch the sky!

One more time!

[Chorus]
Light up the weekend we're alive tonight!
Raise up your voices under stars so bright
Dancing and dreaming hearts in the sky
Together we rise together we fly!
Whoa-oh whoa-oh 
Light up the weekend let's touch the sky!

Whoa-oh whoa-oh  let's touch the sky!
