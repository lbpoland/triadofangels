Watchmen… Watchmen...
... what do you see..?

I saw fire in the sky — not wrath, but warning.
I saw dry bones speaking — not dead, but forming.
Scrolls unrolled with thunder's mark,
A voice cried out — alone, but stark.

He wept through Isaiah's pen.
He warned through Jeremiah's tears.
He breathed through Ezekiel's flame,
And still… we closed our ears.

One voice… then another…
Still we sleep… still we cover…

This is the cry of the watchmen
The voice that won't be stilled.
The fire that burns through silence
The word that must be filled.

We call in shadowed morning,
We cry on midnight's wall
Return, return, O people…
Before the towers fall.

He was despised and rejected of men…
The word of the Lord came to me, saying…
Son of man, can these bones live?

This is the cry of the watchmen
On broken walls we stand
Not kings, not warriors
Just fire in the hand

The wind still speaks His warning,
The flame still knows His call
Return, return, O people
Before the towers fall.

Write the vision, bold and clear,
Sound the horn — the time draws near.
Cry aloud through midnight’s fall,
The watchmen rise… they heed the call.
