Wake up early, boots hit the floor,
Sunrise burnin' through the old screen door.
Gas tank full, got the radio loud,
Gonna take this freedom, shake this town.
Leather jacket, eagle patch,
Flag on the back, we're built to match.
Every mile, every song,
We ride the line, we ride it strong.

Wind in my face, sun on my skin,
Livin' loud, let the summer begin.
From dirt roads to the open highway,
We're born to ride, born to fly away.
Raise the flag, light the spark,
We're burnin' rubber through the dark.
Crank it up, let it scream,
This is the American dream.

Raise your fists, hit the gas,
Born to ride, born to last!

Born to ride free, under the sky,
Wheels on fire, stars in our eyes.
Born to ride free, never back down,
Runnin' this country, town to town.
Born to ride free, this is our song,
Blast it loud, all night long.
Born to ride free, hearts on fire,
We light the road, we take it higher!

Old guitars, worn-out strings,
Voices raised when the freedom rings.
Every line on this weathered face,
Tells the story of this place.
We don't break, we don't fall,
We stand proud, we stand tall.
One more mile, one more song,
Born to ride, all life long!

Raise your fists, hit the gas,
Born to ride, born to last!

Born to ride free, under the sky,
Wheels on fire, stars in our eyes.
Born to ride free, never back down,
Runnin' this country, town to town.
Born to ride free, this is our song,
Blast it loud, all night long.
Born to ride free, hearts on fire,
We light the road, we take it higher!

Born to rideâ€¦ free!
