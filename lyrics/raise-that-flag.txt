Sunset burning on a county road
Radio humming that rebel soul
Dust on my boots flag on my truck
Rolling down this highway chasing luck
American heart born to run
Chasing the light of the setting sun
Crack a beer hear the band
Sing it loud across this land

Farm boys laughing by the old church gate
Mamas calling Don't be late
Fourth of July the town's alive
Banjos picking bonfires high
Motorcycles muscle cars
Sparking under the summer stars
Crank it up let's make a sound
Feel the beat shake this ground

Raise your voice let it ring
Every heart let freedom sing

Raise that flag let it fly
Red white and blue across the sky
Raise that flag let it wave
For every dreamer for every brave
Raise that flag shout it loud
We stand together we stand proud
Raise that flag let it fly
On this Fourth of July

Old man's voice on the porch swing sighs
Son don't forget the sacrifice
Every freedom every song
Paid in blood to carry on
So here we stand here we roar
Voices echoing shore to shore
Crank it up let the chorus fly
Sing it proud into the sky

Raise your voice let it ring
Every heart let freedom sing

Raise that flag let it fly
Red white and blue across the sky
Raise that flag let it wave
For every dreamer for every brave
Raise that flag shout it loud
We stand together we stand proud
Raise that flag let it fly
On this Fourth of July
