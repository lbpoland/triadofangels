Before breath, before bone… before flame…
He was

No orbit
No tide
No light
Only the silence of possibility
And then…
He spoke

Let there be the sound of beginning
Let there be fire not born of stars
Let the darkness split like skin —
And light, His breath, expand across the void

Oceans knew His voice before they had a name
Mountains rose in worship before man could speak
Dust obeyed before it was man
And Eden waited — perfect, untouched

But pride entered
A whisper coiled in reason
Fruit fell
Hearts followed
And the world forgot the Word

But He was not finished
He made covenant with dust —
Not to destroy, but to redeem
He carved law into stone
He carved love into womb
He planted prophecy in every page

He came not as flame
But as flesh
Not a sword
But a lamb
Not a throne
But a cradle…
Still, the stars recognized Him

He wept with the broken
He bled for the killers
He walked roads man built —
But His cross was carved before they paved them

The Word became flesh and dwelt among us…
And the darkness has not overcome it…

We are not survivors — we are prophecy fulfilled
We are not orphans — we are sons and daughters of fire
This isn't the end of darkness —
It is the return of Light

Let there be breath again
Let there be truth again
Let there be us again —
Born not of earth
But of the Word

In the beginning…
He spoke…
and we became
