He stepped where stars once bowed.
Born where blood runs cold.
We stood armed, yet still
Were told to fold our wings and hold.
We saw the dust prepare a crib.
We saw the womb stretch time.
No angel warned the kings that night.
The flame… began to dim and climb.

He walked where breath forgets its name.
Where bones are bruised by years.
He smiled in homes of open wounds
And tasted salt from human tears.
They saw a man who dined with shame...
We saw the God who fed the stars.
He stooped to draw in dirt with hands
That once held galaxies afar.

He healed the blind — not with decree,
But mud made from His spit.
He didn't shout. He didn't rise.
He let the cross... be lit.
We could've stopped the lash and thorn.
One word, and we could flood.
But He said nothing. Held His breath
And wore the weight… of blood.

He was despised and rejected of men…
Surely He has borne our griefs…
And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us
And we beheld His glory…

Messiah…
Messiah....
Messiah...

Not with sword, but wound.
Not with fire, but bone.
He didn't roar… He wept.
He didn't conquer… He knelt.
We saw Him…
Break the bread.
Lift the cross...
And say… nothing!

Messiah reigns — from splintered wood.
The King they missed — the Lamb that stood.
He bore our weight, He walked our grave —
He cried for those… He came to save.
No angels sang. No thrones arose.
He died alone — so we'd be known.
He bled… and called it love.

Behold…
The Lamb of God…
Who takes away…
The sin of the world.
John Chapter 1,  29...

King of kings and Lord of Lords...
Revelation 19,  16...

At the name of Jesus every knee should bow,
In heaven and on earth and under the earth,
And every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord,
To the glory of God the Father.
Philippians 2, 10 to 11...
