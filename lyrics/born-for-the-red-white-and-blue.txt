Dust rising on a country mile
Radio crackling that old-time style
Pickup rolling through the evening heat
American boots on an American street
Flags hanging off the hardware store
Sparklers spinning by the corner door
Grandma's laughing the kids run wild
Fourth of July in a freedom style

Steel strings hum on a porch swing tune
Fireworks pop under a silver moon
Neighbors gather stories old and new
Sharing a beer for the red white and blue
We've seen hard days we've seen long nights
We've held the line we've fought the fight
From coast to coast from town to town
When the flag goes up we all stand proud

Raise your glass raise your song
This land's been ours all along

We were born for the red white and blue
Rolling thunder rolling true
Under the stars under the sky
Raise your voices let 'em fly
We were born for the red white and blue
Through the fire we push on through
Sing it loud sing it strong
Born for the red white and blue all along

Riverboats drift and the bonfires glow
Old men talk 'bout days long ago
Young hearts dance on the courthouse square
Freedom's spirit in the summer air
We don't forget we don't let go
Every star on that flag we know
It's in the dirt it's in the fight
It's in the music on a July night

Raise your glass raise your song
This land's been ours all along

We were born for the red white and blue
Rolling thunder rolling true
Under the stars under the sky
Raise your voices let 'em fly
We were born for the red white and blue
Through the fire we push on through
Sing it loud sing it strong
Born for the red white and blue all along


Born for the red white and blueâ€¦ all along
