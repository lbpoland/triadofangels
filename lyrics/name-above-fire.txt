Your name… still speaks in fire…

I have wandered wide as oceans
Tried to hold the sky in hands
But only when I dropped my glory
Did I start to understand

You didn't ask for monuments
You asked for me to kneel
You didn't come to bind my power
You came to break the seal

So here I lay my crowns and call
No other name above it all

Your name above fire
Still carves through the storm
Where fear once shouted
Now peace is born

Your name above ashes
Turns graves into skies
You called me chosen
Now my soul can rise

I remember…
When I sang to silence
When doubt danced louder than grace
But still, Your voice returned like lightning
And lifted me from that place

No idol holds me
No grave defines me
No lie outshines me
No fear confines me

I know the Name that wrote my name

Speak through me like rivers roar
Holy is the flame You pour
Let me burn with heaven's will
A voice made still… yet never still

Your name above fire
Forever will reign
You walk on the ashes
You rewrite the pain

Let kingdoms crumble
Let empires fade
We sing for the glory
No fire can evade

Jesus… Jesus…
The flame still knows You
And so do I

Name above… name above… fire
