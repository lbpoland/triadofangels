Under painted skies, we walk this road,
Barefoot hearts where the fireflies glow.
Every step we take, every dream we hold,
Brings us closer to the stories told.

Whispers drift beneath the summer stars,
Carried by the wind, near and far.
Fingers intertwined, hearts aligned,
On this Fourth, we leave no one behind.

Raise your hands, let the night unfold,
We're the echoes of the brave, the bold.

This is where we belong tonight,
Under fireworks that fill the sky with light.
Through every battle, through every fight,
We rise together, hearts burning bright.
Raise the anthem, let it fly —
This is where we belong tonight.

On every porch, every small-town street,
We carry voices we've yet to meet.
Stories written on the backs of time,
Etched in love, in blood, in rhyme.

Raise your hands, let the night unfold,
We're the echoes of the brave, the bold.

This is where we belong tonight,
Under fireworks that fill the sky with light.
Through every battle, through every fight,
We rise together, hearts burning bright.
Raise the anthem, let it fly —
This is where we belong tonight.

This is where we belong tonight,
Under fireworks that fill the sky with light.
Through every battle, through every fight,
We rise together, hearts burning bright.
Raise the anthem, let it fly —
This is where we belong tonight.
