The stone was sealed.
The night was thick.
The air was silent
Heavy, sick.

But light does not
Obey the tomb.
And truth unrolls
Where death once bloomed.

The grave cracked wide
Not just one.
But every grave
Under the sun.

From shame to loss,
From fear to flame,
He called the buried
By their name.

Every grave shall open,
Every chain shall fall.
The voice of resurrection
Will echo through them all.

No lie can keep us buried,
No fear can make us stay.
He walks where death once ruled
And leads the light our way.

He spoke to dry bones
And they rose.
He whispered truth
And silence froze.

The grave is not
The end we see
It's just the start
Of who we'll be.

Every grave shall open
Every name be called.
No tomb too heavy,
No soul too small.

He rose, and now
We rise as well.
The light has broken
Every shell.

The breath of God
Still splits the stone.
No one buried
Stands alone.
